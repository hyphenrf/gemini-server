Immediate:
- Properly close handled SSL connections
- Make code asynchronous (I'm learning as I go)
- Make sure all handled resources are closed properly (Gc hooks?)
- Context should be globally accessed within the module instead of being passed
  around.
- optionally pass host to handler registry function in addition to path.
  Allowing for host-defined behaviour.

Intermediate:
- Break dependency on openssl by using Mirage's TLS
- Consider breaking dependency on Text in favour of more homebrew utf-8 handling

Final:
- Make the implementation more performant (benchmarks) and write tests where
  input is to be expected.
