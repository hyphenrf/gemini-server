Immediate:
o Properly close handled SSL connections
- Make code asynchronous (I'm learning as I go)
- Make sure all handled resources are closed properly (Gc hooks?)
- Context should be globally accessed within the module instead of being passed
  around.
o optionally pass host to handler registry function in addition to path.
  Allowing for host-defined behaviour.

Intermediate:
- SNI
o Write Examples
- Write *more* Examples
o Break dependency on openssl by using Mirage's TLS
- Consider breaking dependency on Text in favour of more homebrew utf-8 handling
- Right now no throw is handled (ssl, unix, ...). Should we handle them
  ourselves or should we let user decide?

Final:
- Make the implementation more performant (benchmarks) and write tests where
  input is to be expected.
